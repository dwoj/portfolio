<h2> :eyes: About me</h2> 

My name is Dominika Wojtecka. I was working as an accountant for 6 years. I had an opportunity to participate in a project to implement a new accounting system, so it was my first time when I met testing, bug reporting and retests of the bugs. I decided to change my career path and I took my first step into the IT world. Two years ago I started learning Python and last summer time I spent on the Python internship in a small startup. Now I am working with Salesforce technology in the international company, I am a part of the testers team in the project for construction equipment company. My experience gained in different projects and my technical background allows me to perform excellent functional validation and build effective communication within the project team and business users.
